# HPUXConnector

This connector is a custom connector for SailPoint IdentityIQ to support HP-UX application type. It uses Jsch to implement SSH shell command 
to execute command on target system. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you to install and deploy HPUXConnector on your local SailPoint IdentityIQ application for development and testing purposes. 
You are welcome to trace the source or customized on your own requirements.

### Prerequisites

1. SSH should be installed on HP-UX target server.
2. Rights or privilege required.

Following Rights are needed with root privilege:

```
/bin/chmod, /usr/sbin/useradd, /usr/sbin/usermod, /usr/sbin/userdel, /usr/sbin/groupadd, /usr/sbin/groupmod,
/usr/sbin/groupdel, /usr/bin/passwd, /usr/bin/last, /usr/bin/groups, /bin/rm, /bin/echo, /usr/bin/chage,
/usr/bin/find, /bin/cat /etc/shadow, /bin/cat /etc/passwd, /bin/cat /etc/group, /usr/bin/etc/pwget, /usr/bin/grget, 
/bin/grep, /usr/bin/awk, /user/bin/id, /usr/sbin/userdbset, /usr/lbin/modprpw, /usr/sbin/userstat
```

If you want to use sudo user to perform operations, sudo user must be configured with the following rights and permissions,
An entry in /etc/sudoers file should look similar to the following:

```
username ALL = (root) PASSWD:/bin/chmod, /usr/sbin/useradd, /usr/sbin/usermod, /usr/sbin/userdel, /usr/sbin/groupadd,
/usr/sbin/groupmod, /usr/sbin/groupdel, /usr/bin/passwd, /usr/bin/last, /usr/bin/groups, /bin/rm, /bin/echo, /usr/bin/chage,
/usr/bin/find, /bin/cat /etc/shadow, /bin/cat /etc/passwd, /bin/cat /etc/group, /usr/bin/etc/pwget, /usr/bin/grget, 
/bin/grep, /usr/bin/awk, /user/bin/id, /usr/sbin/userdbset, /usr/lbin/modprpw, /usr/sbin/userstat
```
### Installing

#### Compile

Ant build script is configured under /HPUXConnector/build.xml could manage that compilation and deployment. 
(Replace directory names and project name with names appropriate to the specific installation.)
Make sure that the build.xml is a part of your java project, and does not reside at a location that is external to the project.

To enable Ant view in Eclipse do following:

```
Windows > Show View > Other > Ant > Ant
```
Your Ant View should like this, Click Complie button, will export jar file under /HPUXConnector/build/jar folder:

#### Configure

* Move /HPUXConnector/build/jar/HPUXConnector.jar and /HPUXConnector/lib/jsch-0.1.54.jar under ~/identityiq/WEB-INF/lib

* Move /HPUXConnector/HPUXAttributesForm.xhtml under ~/identityiq/define/applications

* Start IIQ and import /HPUXConnector/HP-UX-Direct.xml

## Deployment
